Imagine you send a transaction on a blockchain platform. 
How do you know when it's confirmed? Or when a new 
block is added to the chain? Without notifications, 
you'd have to keep checking manually—a tedious 
and time-consuming task.

That's why real-time notifications are a game-changer 
for blockchain users. They instantly inform you about 
important events, enhancing your experience and trust 
in the system. The Pactus blockchain addresses this 
need with PIP-36, a proposal to introduce a 
notification system powered by ZeroMQ, a proven 
solution other major blockchain projects use.

Here's a closer look at why notifications matter 
and how this new system makes interacting with 
the Pactus blockchain easier and more seamless.

## Why Are Notifications Important?
Blockchain platforms are constantly processing 
transactions and creating new blocks. Users 
and applications are left in the dark without 
a way to get instant updates. Real-time notifications 
solve this problem by providing immediate alerts 
for important events.

### For example:
For Wallet Users: Notifications immediately 
tell you when a transaction is confirmed or still pending.

For Developers: Apps and tools can be more efficient 
and responsive, improving the overall user experience.

For Everyday Users: Real-time updates make interacting 
with blockchain platforms easier and less confusing.

## What Is PIP-36?
PIP-36 is a proposal to create a notification system for 
the Pactus blockchain. This system will send real-time alerts 
about key events, such as new blocks or transactions. 
It's designed to help users and developers 
stay updated without extra effort.

## How Does It Help You?
The notification system introduced by PIP-36 
focuses on making life easier for everyone using 
the Pactus blockchain. Here's how:

Timely Alerts: You'll get instant updates when 
waiting for a transaction confirmation or tracking the latest block.

Clear and Simple Info: Notifications are designed 
to provide only the necessary details so you're never overwhelmed.

Better Tools and Apps: Developers can build more 
responsive applications, such as wallets or monitoring tools, 
that always keep users informed.

## Why Is This a Big Deal?
Pactus's notification system isn't just a nice-to-have 
feature—it's a step toward making blockchain technology 
easier and more user-friendly. Eliminating guesswork and 
manual checks makes the platform more accessible to 
everyone, from beginners to experienced users.

## The Future of Pactus
With PIP-36, the Pactus blockchain is setting the 
stage for more improvements. Real-time notifications are just 
the beginning. As the system evolves, it will support even 
more features to make blockchain interactions smoother and more intuitive.

Pactus is proving its commitment to innovation and 
user experience. by adopting a notification service 
Whether you're a developer, investor, or everyday user, 
this feature is designed to make your journey with 
blockchain simpler and better.
